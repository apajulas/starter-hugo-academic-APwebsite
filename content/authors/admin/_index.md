Hi, I'm Abigail! I am an Immunologist-in-training, Diversity advocate, and a sub-par rock climber. As an Immunology PhD candidate, I utilize mouse models and bioinformatic approaches to define the role of Interleukin-9 in allergic asthma, lung cancer, and urinary tract infections. I actively participate in DEI initiatives with the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Latinx and Native Americans in Science chapter at IU. In addition to the problems in my scientific research, I continue to challenge myself with rock climbing problems/routes.

Feel welcomed to connect with me via LinkedIn!
