abstract: "Atopic dermatitis results in profound changes in the function of skin that include diminished barrier function and altered production of anti-microbial peptides. Our previous work in a model of allergic skin inflammation identified a defect in the wound healing process that was dependent on IL-4. In this report we demonstrate that allergic skin inflammation results in a dramatic decrease in the presence of the Vγ3+ dendritic epidermal T cell (DETC) population of γδ T cells in the skin. In mice that express an active Stat6 in T cells, DETC are lost early in life. The loss of DETC is entirely dependent on IL-4 and is recovered with genetic-deficiency of IL-4. Moreover, injection of IL-4 into wild type mice results in acute loss of the DETC population. A similar loss of DETC was observed in mice treated topically with MC903. Wounding of skin from Stat6VT transgenic or MC903-treated mice resulted in decreased production of DETC-dependent cytokines in the skin coincident with diminished wound closure. Importantly, intradermal injection of the DETC-produced cytokine FGF7 rescued the rate of wound closure in mice with allergic skin inflammation. Together, these results suggest that the atopic environment diminishes pro-healing T cell populations in the skin that results in attenuated wound healing responses."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Wang & Pajulas et al. used mouse models of atopic dermatitis to study the impact of FGF7-producing gamma delta T cells on wound healing and tissue repair. They found that an IL-4 rich environment reduces the number of skin-resident gamma delta T cells, thus leading to diminished levels of FGF7 in the inflamed skin"
